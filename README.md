# Download sorter

A tool that allows you to sort your downloaded files in directories. This is my first python script that I built for myself in order to apply what I've just learned.
Feel free to notify me if you find something that I can improve.

## Built With

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

## Run this project

In the [testing_files](../testing_files) directory I've put empty files in order to test rapidly the script. All you need to do is to move the [testing_files](../testing_files)'s content in the root of the project, and run the script. Normally,directories must be created and everything should be sorted immediately.
